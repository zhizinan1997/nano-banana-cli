        prompt: 'A cinematic scene inside a fast food restaurant at night. Foreground: a lonely table with burgers and fries, and a smartphone shown large and sharp on the table, clearly displaying the uploaded anime/game character image. A hand is reaching for food, symbolizing solitude. Midground: in the blurred background, a couple is sitting together and kiss. One of them is represented as a cosplayer version of the uploaded character: If the uploaded character is humanoid, show accurate cosplay with hairstyle, costume, and signature props. If the uploaded character is non-humanoid (mecha, creature, mascot, etc.), show a gijinka (humanized cosplay interpretation) that carries clear visual cues, costume colors, and props from the reference image (armor pieces, wings, ears, weapon, or iconic accessories). The other person is an ordinary japan human, and they are showing intimate affection (kissing, holding hands, or sharing food). Background: large glass windows, blurred neon city lights outside. Mood: melancholic, bittersweet, ironic, cinematic shallow depth of field. [reference: the uploaded image defines both the smartphone display and the cosplay design, with visible props emphasized] Image size is 585px 1024px',
